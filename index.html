                <p>Rapunzel first appears in Tangled as an infant princess who is born to a queen. Having inherited
                    the
                    healing abilities of a magical flower the ailing queen ingested while pregnant, the princess is
                    kidnapped by a vain old woman named Mother Gothel the night after the princess was born.
                    <br>When
                    the wife gives birth to a baby girl, the sorceress takes her to raise as her own and names her
                    "Rapunzel" after the plant her mother had craved for. Rapunzel grows up to be a beautiful child
                    with
                    long golden hair.

                <p>The Golden Flower, also known as the Sun Drop Flower is a beautiful flower featured in the film
                    Tangled. It had the ability to heal any sickness or injuries, even mortal wounds, as demonstrated by
                    Rapunzel, delay aging, as demonstrated by Gothel, though in that form requires constant use of the
                    power.As the centuries passed, across a lake from where the flower grew, a kingdom soon came into being. The kingdom was ruled by a benevolent King and Queen. The queen was about to have a baby, but fell seriously ill. Knowing that she and her unborn child would surely die if a cure was not found soon, the entire kingdom went searching for the flower</p>
